# Springboard

This is a repository to store all of the mini-exercises done though Springboard's Data Science Career Track. If you are doing Springboard, I encourage you not to look at my answers until you have had a good try at the problem. Code will not be updated to reflect changes I might make today - if you want a better look at my skills, see the Berkshire capstone project in particular.
